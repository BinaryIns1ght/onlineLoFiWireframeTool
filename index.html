            The basic synopsis of the project is the user can be able to creare low fidelity wireframe sketches with this project. The user can use various shapes and even place in text to the wireframe to further explain to the viewer on the plans. You can do simple sketches for fun, or create a simplistic blueprint on how to go about designing your work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't like the way your shapes/text is currently formated, you can drag the shape into a position best appropriate to you. If you have made a shape you didn't like, you can right-click on it to delete it, and make another. When you are done, you can press the "Save Sketch" button to save your work. You can name your file as well.

            First, you can start with setting up the background. Set up the color of the background, set the border if you would like to, or even make the background transparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, you place in the parameters for your shape, whether it's the location on where the shape will be places, or the color of the shape's fill/border
          </p>
          <p>
            If you dislike the location set up for the shape, you can drag the shape along to match your ideal plans. If you made a shape you dislike, you can right-click to delete it. You can even alter the size of the shape by scrolling with the mouse wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            If needed/wanted, you can even add text to the canvas to further illustrate your ideas. Similarly to the shapes, you can set up parameters, drag them along, change size, and even delete with the right-click.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are done, you can press the "Save Canvas Button" to save your work.
