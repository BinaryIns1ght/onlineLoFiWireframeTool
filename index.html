            The basic synopsis of the project is the user can be able to creare low fidelity wireframe sketches with this project. The user can use various shapes and even place in text to the wireframe to further explain to the viewer on the plans. You can do simple sketches for fun, or create a simplistic blueprint on how to go about designing your work.

            If you have made a shape you didn't like, you can click on it to delete it, and make another. When you are done, you can press the "Save Sketch" button to save your work. You can name your file as well.

            First, you place in the parameters for your shape, whether it's the location on where the shape will be places, or the color of the shape's fill/border.
          </p>
          <p>
            If needed/wanted, you can even add text to the canvas to further illustrate your ideas. Similarly to the shapes, you can set up parameters, drag them along, change size, and even delete with a mouse click.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are done, you can press the "Save Canvas Button" to save your work. Be sure to select the correct file type if needed.
